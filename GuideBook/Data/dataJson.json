            "description": "Bishkek, formerly Pishpek and Frunze, is the capital and largest city of Kyrgyzstan (Kyrgyz Republic). Bishkek is also the administrative centre of the Chuy Region. The province surrounds the city, although the city itself is not part of the province, but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan. It is also near the Kazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan border.\n\nIn 1825, the Khanate of Kokand established the fortress of \"Pishpek\" to control local caravan routes and to collect tribute from Kyrgyz tribes. On 4 September 1860, with the approval of the Kyrgyz, Russian forces led by Colonel Apollon Zimmermann destroyed the fortress. In 1868, a Russian settlement was established on the site of the fortress under its original name, \"Pishpek\". It lay within the General Governorship of Russian Turkestan and its Semirechye Oblast.\n\nIn 1925, the Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast was established in Russian Turkestan, promoting Pishpek to its capital. In 1926, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union renamed the city as Frunze, after the Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze (1885–1925), who was born there. In 1936, the city of Frunze became the capital of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic, during the final stages of the national delimitation in the Soviet Union. In 1991, the Kyrgyz parliament changed the capital's name to \"Bishkek\".\n\nBishkek is situated at an altitude of about 800 metres (2,600 ft), just off the northern fringe of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too Range, an extension of the Tian Shan mountain range. These mountains rise to a height of 4,895 metres (16,060 ft). North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighbouring Kazakhstan. The Chui River drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the Turkestan–Siberia Railway by a spur line.\n\nBishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous Soviet-style apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards. There are also thousands of smaller privately built houses, mostly outside the city centre. Streets follow a grid pattern, with most flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels, watering innumerable trees to provide shade in the hot summers.\n\nHistory\n\nKokhand rule\n\nOriginally a caravan rest stop (possibly founded by the Sogdians) on one of the branches of the Silk Road through the Tian Shan range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the khan of Kokand with a mud fort. In the last years of Kokhand rule, the Pishpek fortress was led by Atabek, the Datka.\n\nTsarist era\n\nIn 1860 Imperial Russia annexed the area, and the military forces of Colonel Apollon Ernestovich Zimmermann took and razed the fort. Colonel Zimmermann rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort and appointed field-Poruchik Titov as head of a new Russian garrison. The Imperial Russian government redeveloped the site from 1877 onward, encouraging the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile land to develop.\n\nSoviet era\n\nFrunze statue near the railway station\n\nIn 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established Kirghiz ASSR and was renamed \"Frunze\" after Mikhail Frunze, Lenin's close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the revolutions of 1905 and 1917 and during the Russian Civil War of the early 1920s.\n\nIndependence era\n\nThe early 1990s were tumultuous. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe ethnic riots in southern Kyrgyzstan that threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991 and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the breakup of the Soviet Union. Before independence, the majority of Bishkek's population were ethnic Russians. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city's population, and about 7–8% in 2011.\n\nToday, Bishkek is a modern city with many restaurants and cafes, and with many second-hand European and Japanese cars and minibuses crowding its streets. However, streets and sidewalks have fallen into disrepair since the 1990s. At the same time, Bishkek still preserves its former Soviet feel with Soviet-period buildings and gardens prevailing over newer structures.\n\nBishkek is also the country's financial centre, with all of the country's 21 commercial banks headquartered there. During the Soviet era, the city was home to a large number of industrial plants, but most have been shut down since 1991 or now operate on a much-reduced scale. One of Bishkek's largest employment centres today is the Dordoy Bazaar open market, where many of the Chinese goods imported to CIS countries are sold.\n\nGeography\n\nOrientation\n\nThough the city is relatively young, the surrounding area has some sites of interest dating to prehistoric times. There are also sites from the Greco-Buddhist period, the period of Nestorian influence, the era of the Central Asian khanates, and the Soviet period.\n\nRussian Orthodox cathedral of the Holy Resurrection\n\nThe central part of the city is laid out on a rectangular grid plan. The city's main street is the east-west Chui Avenue (Chuy Prospekti), named after the region's main river. In the Soviet era, it was called Lenin Avenue. Along or near it are many of the most important government buildings and universities. These include the Academy of Sciences compound. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as Deng Xiaoping Avenue.\n\nThe main north–south street is Yusup Abdrakhmanov Street, still commonly referred to by its old name, Sovietskaya Street. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centers are located along with it, and in the north, it provides access to Dordoy Bazaar.\n\nErkindik (\"Freedom\") Boulevard runs from north to south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chui Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chui Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard, named after a Communist revolutionary, Felix Dzerzhinsky, and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.\n\nAn important east–west street is Jibek Jolu ('Silk Road'). It runs parallel to Chui Avenue about 2 km (1.2 mi) north of it and is part of the main east–west road of Chui Province. Both the eastern and western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.\n\nThere is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). It is the only Catholic cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThere is a Stadium after Dolon Omurzakov located near the center of Bishkek. This is the largest stadium in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nCity centre\nState Historical Museum, located in Ala-Too Square, the main city square\nState Museum of Applied Arts, containing examples of traditional Kyrgyz handicrafts\nFrunze House Museum\nStatue of Ivan Panfilov in the park near the White House.\nAn equestrian statue of Mikhail Frunze stands in a large park (Boulevard Erkindik) across from the train station.\nThe train station was built in 1946 by German prisoners of war and has survived since then without further renovation or repairs; most of those who built it perished and were buried in unmarked pits near the station.\nThe main government building, the White House, is a huge, seven-story marble block and the former headquarters of the Communist Party of the Kirghiz SSR\nAt Ala-Too Square there is an independence monument where the changing of the guards may be watched.\nOsh Bazaar, west of the city center, is a large, picturesque produce market\nKyrgyz National Philharmonic, concert hall\nOuter neighbourhoods.\nThe Dordoy Bazaar, just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market.\nOutside the city\nThe Kyrgyz Ala-Too mountain range, some 40 kilometres (25 mi) away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the Ala Archa National Park is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away.\n\nDistances\n\nBishkek is about 300 km away directly from the country's second city Osh. However, its nearest large city is Almaty of Kazakhstan, which is 190 km to the east. Furthermore, it is 470 km from Tashkent (Uzbekistan), 680 km from Dushanbe (Tajikistan), and about 1,000 km each from Nur-Sultan (Kazakhstan), Ürümqi (China), Islamabad (Pakistan), and Kabul (Afghanistan).\n\nClimate\n\nBishkek has a Mediterranean-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dsa.), as the average mean temperature in the winter is below 0 °C (32.0 °F). Average precipitation is around 440 millimetres (17 in) per year. Average daily high temperatures range from 3 °C (37.4 °F) in January to about 31 °C (87.8 °F) during July. The summer months are dominated by dry periods, punctuated by the occasional thunderstorm, which produces strong gusty winds and rare dust storms. The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary and protection from much of the damaging weather, as does the smaller mountain chain which runs north-west to south-east. In the winter months, sparse snow storms and frequent heavy fog are the dominating features. There are sometimes temperature inversions, during which the fog can last for days at a time.\n\nAir quality\n\nEmissions of air pollutants in Bishkek amounted to 14,400 tons in 2010. Among all cities in Kyrgyzstan, the level of air pollution in Bishkek is the highest, occasionally exceeding maximum allowable concentrations by several times, especially in the city centre. For example, concentrations of formaldehyde occasionally exceed maximum allowable limits by a factor of four.\n\nResponsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies with the Kyrgyz State Agency of Hydrometeorology. There are seven air-quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde and ammonia.\n\nHousing\n\nAs with many cities in post-Soviet states, housing in Bishkek has undergone extensive changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union. While housing was formerly distributed to citizens in the Soviet era, housing in Bishkek has since become privatised.\n\nThough single family houses are slowly becoming more popular, the majority of the residents live in Soviet-era apartments. Despite the Kyrgyz economy experiencing growth, increases in available housing has been slow with very little new construction. As a result of this growing prosperity and the lack of new formal housing, prices have been rising significantly—doubling from 2001 to 2002.\n\nThose unable to afford the high price of housing within Bishkek, notably internal migrants from rural villages and small provincial towns often have to resort to informal squatter settlements on the outskirts of the city. These settlements are estimated to house 400,000 people or about 30 percent of Bishkek's population. While many of the settlements have lacked basic necessities such as electricity and running water, recently there has been a push by the local government to provide these services.\n\nGovernment\n\nLocal government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor's Office. Askarbek Salymbekov was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, after which his deputy, Arstanbek Nogoev, took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister Daniar Usenov. In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways Nariman Tuleyev was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010. From April 2010 to February 2011 Isa Omurkulov, also a former head of the Kyrgyz Railways, was an interim mayor, and from 4 February 2011 to 14 December 2013 he was re-elected the mayor of Bishkek. Kubanychbek Kulmatov was nominated for election by parliamentary group of Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan in city kenesh, and he was elected as a new mayor on 15 January 2014, and stepped down on 9 February 2016. The next mayor, Albek Sabirbekovich Ibraimov, was also nominated for election by parliamentary group of Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan in city kenesh, and he was elected by Bishkek City Kenesh on 27 February 2016. The current mayor is Aziz Surakmatov, who was elected on 8 August 2018.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nBishkek city covers 169.6 square kilometres (65.5 square miles) and is administered separately and not part of any region. Besides the city proper, one urban-type settlement and one village are administered by the city: Chong-Aryk and Orto-Say. The city is divided into 4 districts: Birinchi May, Lenin, Oktyabr and Sverdlov. Chong-Aryk and Orto-Say are part of Lenin District.\n\nSports\n\nBishkek is home to Spartak, the largest football stadium in Kyrgyzstan and the only one eligible to host international matches. Several Bishkek-based football teams play on this pitch, including six-time Kyrgyzstan League champions, Dordoi Bishkek. Others include Alga Bishkek, Ilbirs Bishkek, and RUOR-Guardia Bishkek./nBishkek hosted the 2014 IIHF Challenge Cup of Asia – Division I.",

The museum contains several exhibits about the cultural heritage of the Kyrgyz people, whose sculptures and objects date from antiquity to the end of the 20th century. It is one of the most important museums in Central Asia.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, one of the objectives was to complete certain ethnographic and archaeological collections, therefore, the construction of a museum to store different types of cultural and historical artifacts of Kyrgyzstan was proposed. The museum was founded in December 9, 1925 as the first scientific institution in Kyrgyzstan. In 1927, the museum was first opened to the public, the museum has received several contributions from historians and ethnographers such as Aleksandr Natanovich Bernshtam.\n\n In 1933, the name of the museum was changed to Museum of Local Customs. In 1943, the name of the museum was changed again to the Museum of National Culture. In 1954, it was renamed the State Historical Museum. In the 1960s it moved to a building constructed in 1928, this building was designed by the architect Zenkov. The current building where the museum is located was built in 1984. The construction of the building was intended to give the museum a distinctive design. It is located near the government house on Ala-Too Square.\n\nIn 2003, there was originally a statue of Lenin at the entrance of the museum but it was moved to the backyard in a more secluded location.\nThe museum has several cave sculptures from the Bronze Age, as well as a series of collections of ancient coins and many ethnographic objects, jewelry and clothing from the 1st to the 5th century. Also, the museum contains various photographs and documents about the formation and development of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic. The museum also houses exhibits on the migration of people in Central Asia.\n\nIn 2016, renovation work began on parts of the museum funded by the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency",

The city has an ethnically mixed population of about 281,900 in 2017, comprising Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, Russians, Tajiks, and other smaller ethnic groups. It is about 5 km from the Uzbekistan border.\n\nOverview\n\nOsh has an important outdoor bazaar which has been taking place on the same spot for the past 2000 years, and was a major market along the Silk Road. The city's industrial base, established during the Soviet period, largely collapsed after the break-up of the Soviet Union and has recently only started to revive.\n\nThe proximity of the Uzbekistan border, which cuts through historically linked territories and settlements, deprives Osh of much of its former hinterland and presents a serious obstacle to trade and economic development. Daily flights from Osh Airport link Osh—and hence the southern part of Kyrgyzstan—to Bishkek and some international destinations, mainly in Russia. Osh has two railway stations and a railway connection to Andijan in neighbouring Uzbekistan, but no passenger traffic and only sporadic freight traffic. Most transport is by road. The recent upgrading of the long and arduous road through the mountains to Bishkek has greatly improved communications.\n\nThe city has several monuments, including one to the southern Kyrgyz \"queen\" Kurmanjan Datka and one of the few remaining statues of Lenin. A Russian Orthodox church, reopened after the demise of the Soviet Union, the second largest mosque in the country (situated beside the bazaar) and the 16th-century Rabat Abdul Khan Mosque can be found here.

Scientists, not without reason, believe that on the site of the mausoleum there used to be an earlier religious building dating back to about the 10th-12th centuries.\n\nBe that as it may, today the Mausoleum of Asaf ibn Burkhiya is one of the oldest monuments preserved in Osh.

            "description": "Karakol is the fourth largest city in Kyrgyzstan, near the eastern tip of Lake Issyk-Kul in Kyrgyzstan, about 150 kilometres (93 mi) from the Kyrgyzstan–China border and 380 kilometres (240 mi) from the capital Bishkek. It is the administrative capital of Issyk-Kul Region. Its area is 44 square kilometres (17 sq mi) and its resident population was 66,294 in 2009 (both including Pristan'-Przheval'sk). To the north, on highway A363, is Tyup and to the southwest Jeti-Ögüz resort.\n\nHistory\n\nA Russian military outpost founded on 1 July 1869, Karakol grew in the 19th century after explorers came to map the peaks and valleys separating Kyrgyzstan from China. In the 1880s Karakol's population surged with an influx of Dungans, Chinese Muslims fleeing warfare in China.\n\nIn 1888, the Russian explorer Nicholay Przhevalsky died in Karakol of typhoid, while preparing for an expedition to Tibet, the city was renamed Przhevalsk in his honor. After local protests, the town was given its original name back in 1921—a decision reversed in 1939 by Stalin to celebrate the centenary of the explorer's birth. Karakol then remained Przhevalsk until the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. However the name has been retained by nearby Pristan'-Przheval'sk.\n\nNearby Issyk Kul Lake was used by the Soviet military as a testing site for torpedo propulsion and guidance systems and Karakol was thus home to a sizable population of military personnel and their families. Karakol continues to be a major hub for visitors of Issyk Kul Lake.\n\nDemographics\n\nKarakol is fourth largest town in Kyrgyzstan after Bishkek, Osh and Jalal-Abad. The population of Karakol, according to the Population and Housing Census of 2009, was 67,100.\n\nGeography\n\nClimate\n\nKarakol features a humid continental climate (Dfb) according to the Köppen climate classification.\n\nSights\n\nThe Urkun Massacre Monument\n\nTerskei Alatoo\n\nKarakol gorge\n\nKarakol is one of Kyrgyzstan's major tourist destinations, serving as a good starting point for the excellent hiking, trekking, skiing and mountaineering in the high central Tian Shan to the south and east. Also this city is culturally rich by different ethnic groups that live here such as Dungan, Uighur, Kalmak, Uzbek, Russians and of course Kyrgyz. The city offers a great opportunity to discover other nationalities and cultures within the city.\n\nPrzhevalsky's grave, a memorial park and a small museum dedicated to his and other Russian explorations in Central Asia are some 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) north of Karakol at Pristan Przhevalsky, overlooking the Mikhailovka inlet of Issyk Kul Lake where the former Soviet torpedo testing facilities were located. Facilities themselves are still a closed, military area.\n\nKarakol has Central Asia's highest ski resort, with 20 km of slopes, situated just 20 minutes from the town. Unlike Shymbulak resort, the riding at Karakol includes forest areas as well as cleared trails.\n\nRussian Orthodox cathedral\n\nKarakol Russian-orthodoxy church\n\nThe cathedral was originally built of stone in 1872, when Karakol was a garrison town established as an outpost on the edges of the Tsarist Russian Empire. It was destroyed in 1890 by an earthquake and the current cathedral was built out of wood on a brick base. It took six years to complete, and was finally completed in 1895. During the period of construction, a yurt served the congregation as a church. It has seen considerable service, not just as a church. During an anti-Russian uprising in 1916 its monks were brutally murdered.\n\nOver the years, particularly following the Revolution in 1917, it has been used as an educational center housing a school, ladies' gymnasium and an institution of Higher Education; a Sports Hall; a Theater; a Dance Hall and even as a Coal Store. Then, in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Independence of Kyrgyzstan, the local authority once again gave the building back to the church, with the proviso that all further restorations were their responsibility.\n\nDungan mosque\n\nKarakol Dungan Mosque\n\nThe Issyk-kul Central Mosque of Karakol city was built for the local Dungan community by an initiative of Ibrahim Aji. He invited the famous Beijing architect Chou Seu and 20 carvers with the skills of traditional Chinese architecture and composition techniques for building the mosque. The construction of outbuildings and other work involved local craftsmen. Construction of the mosque began in 1904 and was completed in 1910. Ingenious techniques allowed the builders to build the mosque with no nails. The mosque holds 42 based pillars and encircling the building is multi-tiered wooden cornice, decorated with images of plants like grapes, pomegranates, pears and peaches. From 1929 to 1947 (during the Soviet era) the mosque was used as a storehouse. In 1947, the building was given to the Muslim community and continues to function as a mosque. It is registered as a historical monument and protected by law. Today the mosque is open to visitors.\n\nPrzhevalsky Museum\n\nNikolay Przhevalsky was one of the first Russian Scientist-Geographer to start detailed studies of the geography, flora and fauna of the Central Asian countries. Beginning from 1870, he arranged four large expeditions to Mongolia, China and Tibet. During his expeditions he revealed the exact directions of the mountain ranges and borders of the Tibet Mountains. He described the nature, relief, climate, flora and fauna in the territories under his study and discovered over 200 plant species. Przhevalsky also collected an enormous zoological collection which comprised several thousand species of plants, animals, birds, fishes and insects. In the year of 1888, he died from typhoid fever on the eve of his fifth expedition to Central Asia; he was buried on the Issyk-Kul lakeside not far from the city of Karakol. The Memorial Museum of N. M. Przhevalsky was opened on 29 April 1957 in Karakol.\n\nKarakol Historical Museum\n\nThis small museum was the pre-revolutionary summer home of the Iliana merchant family. During the turbulent years of 1918–20 the building earned its socialist stripes as headquarters of the Regional Revolutionary Committee, and was subsequently transformed into a museum by order of the Soviet Council of Ministers in 1948. Scythian artifacts include enormous bronze pots retrieved from Lake Issyk-Kul, displayed alongside exhibits on petroglyphs in the area. Besides a comprehensive display of traditional Kyrgyz punched leather work, felt wall hangings and woven yurt decorations, the museum has a colorful collection of national costumes, examples of finely worked silver jewellery and a good exhibition of Kyrgyz applied art. One hall covers the region's flora and fauna – much of which is endangered and listed in the 'Red Book' (a Soviet inventory of protected species). The museum is also worth visiting to gain a Soviet perspective of history in the region. A couple of walls relating to Kyrgyz union with Russia and the subsequent revolution are now historical artifacts in themselves.\n\nBugu-Ene Zoo\n\nKarakol Zoological Park was founded in 1987. This is the only zoo in Kyrgyzstan. After the demise of the Soviet Union, the economics of the country collapsed, and it concerned the newly created object culture. In 2001, closing the zoo was considered. However, sponsors were found, which not only allowed to preserve the wildlife area, but also allowed to keep it in a relatively prosperous state. Nowadays the buildings, cages and cells are not new, but in very good condition. There are Japanese macaques, bears, wolf, deer, camels, lamas, Przewalski's horse, peacock, lions and many others.\n\nAnimal Market\n\nA Kyrgyz Goat at the Karakol animal market\n\nEarly on Sunday mornings one of Kyrgyzstan's biggest animal markets takes place around 2 km north of central Karakol. Locals loading and unloading sheep into the back of a sedan is not an uncommon sight. The setting amid semi-derelict flour mills might seem unprepossessing, but on clear days the backdrop of white-topped mountains is more striking from here than from the town center. A series of earthen unloading platforms lead north. Jostle through the chaos to reach a bigger main compound one block north, where horses and embossed leather saddlery are for sale. On foot the bazaar is about 25 minutes' walk from City Center.",

In Turkestan, a new flowering of wooden temple architecture began. The plans of these churches were created on the basis of the cross-domed model, but they had modifications, mainly due to the impossibility of giving the tree a rounded shape and smooth outlines.\n\nThe temple is three-aisled with a rectangular apse. The length of the temple is 35.5 meters, the width is 18 meters, the height of the walls is 5.1 meters, the height of the naves is 4.2 meters. Initially, it was supposed to build a temple in the form of an equal-ended cross, but later it acquired a rectangular-broken configuration. During the construction, an old square brick plinth was used. The plinth rests on granite blocks and a cobblestone foundation. The temple is crowned with five heads. The porch is made of granite blocks filled with cement mortar. A bell tower was built on the western side.",

In 1907, here comes Chou-Si - an architect from Beijing, who with a group of builders numbering about 20 people (roofers, bricklayers, and woodcarvers) began preparing materials for a future mosque. The Tien-Shan spruce, elm and local poplar became the building material, and walnut was used for decorating. The preparation took three years, and in 1910, Dungan Mosque, built in the best traditions of Chinese architecture, was finished. One can be trace architectural style of the Qing era in the design of the mosque.\n\nThe unusual structure is that in the process of its construction not a single nail was used: all parts of the building are connected by cuttings and grooves.

Dungan mosqueNumerous columns stand along the building’s perimeter, windows   on southern and northern walls bring light and warmth. The western part of the mosque is without windows, since the faces of worshipers are turned here. A unique work of art is the eaves’ ornamental patterns - they depict scenes from traditional Chinese mythology: dragons, phoenixes, lions, fabulous creatures. Legends say they guard the mosque from evil spirits.\n\nThe color of the building and roof, as well as the materials were selected according to certain canons. The walls are purple. The columns are red, as it protects against disaster and evil spirits. The roof of the mosque is green to bring prosperity and happiness. The carved patterns are foliage patterns painted green and images of mythical creatures, painted yellow – the color of wealth and greatness.\n\nDungan mosque is a vivid example of Chinese culture.

            "description": "Jalal-Abad is the administrative and economic centre of Jalal-Abad Region in southwestern Kyrgyzstan. Its area is 88 square kilometres (34 sq mi), and its resident population was 97,172 in 2009 and is officially estimated at 109,200 in January 2019. It is situated at the north-eastern end of the Fergana valley along the Kögart River valley, in the foothills of the Babash Ata mountains, very close to Uzbekistan border.\n\nOverview\n\nJalal-Abad is known for its mineral springs in its surroundings, and the water from the nearby Azreti-Ayup-Paygambar spa was long believed to cure lepers. Several Soviet era sanatoriums offer mineral water treatment programs for people with various chronic diseases. Bottled mineral water from the region is sold around the country and abroad.\n\nJalal-Abad street scene\n\nOne of Kyrgyzstan's main branches of the Silk Road passed through Jalalabat and the region has played host to travelers for thousands of years, although few archaeological remains are visible today – except in some of the more remote parts of the region – such as Saimalu Tash and the Chatkal valley. These have included travelers, traders, tourists and pilgrims (to the various holy sights) and sick people visiting the curative spas such as in the Ayub Tau mountain, at the altitude of 700 m above sea level some three kilometers out of town.\n\nThere is a legend that the water from the Azreti-Ayup-Paygambar (the Prophet Job) spa cured lepers. According to the legend there was a grave, a mosque and the khan's palace near the spa.\n\nJalal-abad is a Persian suffix often used in city names in Persianate societies to refer to the person who founded the community. It is said that Jalalabat was named after Jalal ad Din, who was renowned for setting up Caravanserais to serve travelers and many pilgrims who came to the holy mountain.\n\nIn early 19th century a small Kokand fortress was built, and a small kishlak grew up around this. The local people were engaged in agriculture and trade and provided services to the pilgrims visiting the spas. Then, in the 1870s, Russian settlers came to the region. They set up a garrison town and military hospital.\n\nClimate\n\nJalal-Abad has a hot, dry-summer continental climate (Dsa) according to the Köppen climate classification. There is more rainfall in winter than in summer. The average annual temperature in Jalal-Abad is 12.3 °C (54.1 °F). About 416 mm (16.38 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nTourism\n\nJalalabad's Theater\n\nThe Jalal-Abad Region is known for its walnuts and scenery. Local sites include the Arslanbob Waterfalls and Sary-Chelek Nature Reserve and Lake. In the city itself, sites include the town square and the culture park, which contains various sculptures and Jalalabad's theater.",

Its area is 84 square kilometres (32 sq mi), and its estimated population was 40,000 as of January 2019. The town was established as a fortress on the caravan route in 1868. It is situated on both banks of the Naryn River (one of the main head waters of the Syr Darya), which cuts a picturesque gorge through the town. The city has two regional museums and some hotels, but is otherwise residential.\n\nOverview\n\nFrom Naryn, the main road (one of the branches of the ancient Silk Road) runs south through the sparsely settled central Kyrgyz highlands to the Torugart Pass and China. At present, this is the main transport link from Kyrgyzstan to China. Naryn hosts one of three campuses of the University of Central Asia (UCA). The University was founded in 2000 by the governments of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, and His Highness the Aga Khan. It is the world's first internationally chartered institution of higher education. The UCA currently operates a School of Professional and Continuing Education (SPCE), with a School of Undergraduate Studies and a Graduate School of Development in the process of being established. Undergraduate classes at the University of Central Asia’s (UCA) Naryn, Kyrgyz Republic campus commenced on 5 September 2016.\n\nDemographics\n\nNaryn is the tenth largest city by population in Kyrgyzstan.

The town was founded by East Slavic settlers in 1877. To the south is the Besh-Tash (\"five rocks\") valley with the Besh-Tash National Park.\n\nOverview\n\nIts economy has traditionally been oriented towards the ancient city of Taraz (once named Talas and Dzhambul) in present day Kazakhstan. The Talas valley has suffered severely from the imposition of rigid border controls by Kazakhstan following the demise of the Soviet Union, as transport and trade links to the rest of Kyrgyzstan are now constrained by the mountains separating it from the Chuy Valley and Bishkek. Though much transportation does occur from Bishkek to Talas by transiting through Kazakhstan via the border crossings at Chaldovar in Chuy and then re-crossing into the Talas valley of Kyrgyzstan at Taraz. The only drivable road within the borders of Kyrgyzstan to Bishkek and the rest of the country crosses two mountain passes that rise to heights of more than 3000 meters above sea level over the Ötmök Pass into the Suusamyr Valley and then again the Töö Ashuu Pass before descending to the Chuy Valley and Bishkek\n\nManas\n\nManas, the mythical Kyrgyz national hero, is said to have been born in the Ala Too mountains in Talas oblast. A few kilometers outside Talas lies a mausoleum, supposedly that of Manas, called the Kümböz Manas. However, the inscription on its richly decorated facade dedicates it to \"...the most glorious of women Kenizek-Khatun, the daughter of the Emir Abuka\". Legend explains that Manas' wife Kanikey ordered a deliberately false inscription in order to mislead her husband's enemies and prevent the desecration of his body. The building, known as Manastin Khumbuzu or The Ghumbez of Manas, is thought to have been built in 1334. It now contains a museum dedicated to the epic. A ceremonial mound also lies nearby.",

The lake is 180 km long and 70 km wide, the depth in the deepest place reaches 668 meters (the average depth is 300 meters). The lake never freezes (hence its name), despite the fact that it is surrounded by snow-capped mountain peaks.\nThe Issyk-Kul region was unknown to the Western world until Russian researchers, such as, for example, Semenov-Tyan-Shansky, visited it with an expedition.\nIn the East, these places have been known since ancient times. The Chinese traveler Zhang Jian wrote about the lake, who visited Issyk-Kul in 128 BC. during his journey in 138-126 BC. The mention of the lake in the written sources of another Chinese explorer - Xuan Zhan is found in the description of his 16-year expedition.\nThe name «Issyk-Kul» is first found in the anonymous work \"The Borders of the World from East to West\", written in the Tajik language in 982 AD. This work also mentions the exact size of the lake.\nFrom Bishkek, you can get to Lake Issyk-Kul through the Boom Gorge, or take a shortcut through the Chon-Kemin Valley. The lake lies at the bottom of a depression and has no outflow. Mountains ring the lake, there are several valleys in its vicinity that are worth visiting: these are Grigoryevka and Semenovka in the north, Barskoon in the south and the valley around Karakol.\n\nThe Kungei (\"Sunny\") Ala-Too mountains are dotted with trekking routes in north side of the lake, including those that lead from the lake towards the city of Almaty, while in the south lie Teskey Ala-Too (\"Dark Mountains\"). These mountain ranges protect the Issyk-Kul depression from icy winds and dry winds. Moreover, the valley is a rare combination of a unique climate: sea, steppe, mountain and a zone of eternal glaciers. And the very emergence of Issyk-Kul is still a kind of \"geological mystery\".\n\nLake Issyk-Kul is a unique place in its own way, which is famous for its warm sandy beaches, thermo-mineral radon springs, alpine meadows, coniferous forests of the park type. All this splendor is located next to the fascinating mountain peaks and glaciers, among which there are many of the highest mountain verticals.\nKyrgyz refer to Lake Issyk-Kul as the \"Pearl of the Tyan Shan\". And in 2004, the government even declared the lake a national treasure.\n\nDue to its size, Issyk-Kul sometimes looks like a continental sea with a fairly large number of beaches. Most of the beach areas are located on the northern coast and are popular place to visit for tourists. A large number of hotels, sanatoriums, boarding houses and guest houses are located around the lake. The tourist season usually lasts from June to September, but the peak season falls on the period from July 25 to August 25. At this time, it is difficult to find a place in a hotel, and prices reach their limit.\nFor people with health problems, a wide range of effective spa treatment is offered. There is an excellent resort area with mud and spa treatment. In southern coast there is a Dead Salt Lake - an analogue of the Israeli Dead Sea.\nIssyk-Kul district is a nesting and resting place for many migratory and wintering birds, such as swans, geese, ducks, cranes, and many other representatives of the fauna.\nThe number of sunny hours per year in this region is 2,900. Due to the influence of mountain ranges in the north and south on the climate, this region does not suffer from sudden temperature changes. In summer, the temperature is usually about 25-28 °C, but since the lake is located at an altitude of about 1606 meters, it can be quite cool at night.",

The lake is already thought to be reported in the account given by Rubruquis of his voyage to the Qaraqorum, but he thinks it to be an inner sea, the oriental end of the Lake Balkach. He gives an approximate description of the area and mentions the winds, which are \"so strong that people do not traverse the lake without great peril.\"  A Russian traveller named Putimtsoff was the first to knowingly visit the lake in 1811.

Thirty years later Alexander Schrenk explored the lake and its surroundings.  Literally, the name Ala-kul would mean 'variegated lake,' although it probably takes its name from the Ala-Тoo mountains lying further north",

A huge percentage of water salinity places the lake on a par with the Dead Sea in Israel or the Great Salt Lake in the US, but on a smaller scale. For example, you can relax in the water without exerting any effort at all. Beware of water getting into your eyes, because there will be discomfort. The shore of the lake is covered with curative clay of different colors, as well as with sharp crystals of salt, which are formed from the drying out of water. The size of the lake is very small: the length of the coastline is 1.5 km, and the depth is 11m. Despite its very small size, because of its salinity, it does not freeze even in winter. Paradoxically, but very popular now, this lake was almost unknown until the 2000s, and more or less only started being visited by tourists in 2010. The lake is very close to the coastline of Issyk-Kul – just 400 meters away. The area around the lake is very picturesque: dried up hills of red and white sand, a large bay and a panorama of the Terskey Ala-Too Range",

Scientists believe that in this place was previously a medieval capital city of Balasagun, owned by a large and powerful Turkic feudal Karakhanid Empire (X—XII centuries). While being on the Silk Road, the city was developed and considered one of the richest Central Asia settlements. In the XIII century Balasagun captured Mongols, and in two centuries it completely disappeared from the face of the Earth. From the former greatness remained only Burana Tower, ruins of fortress and defensive structures. During excavations, the remains of water pipes, luxury items and other evidences of the former greatness of the city were found.\n\nIn the 1970th there was reconstruction of the tower, when restored destroyed parts of the upper brickwork and was rebuilt the octagonal basement of the tower. Thanks to this, there are many tourists and local history enthusiasts come there to see the tower and climb to its top part through its preserved spiral staircase.\n\nToday among people there are many legends about origin, history and fate of the tower. According to one of the legends, one powerful Khan had a beautiful daughter named Monarch, whom he loved and protected. One day he called all the starkets and clairvoyants from the whole area and ordered the future of the girl. They all, except one, predicted a happy life to the girl. The same aksakal said, \"I can tell you only the truth, although you can and execute me for it. Your daughter's fate is sad. As soon as she lived to her 16th birthday, as a black Spider bites her, and she will die immediately.\"\n\nHan was furious, but he couldn't help but pay attention to that prediction. So he built a high Tower and had spent this Starship in a small room below the Tower, and his daughter placed in another room upstairs Tower in a single room.\n\nThe daughter grew in the Tower, admiring the valleys through four Windows in the Dome that came out on all sides of the world – North, South, East and West. The servants brought her food and water in the basket with food, climbed the stairs, mounted on the outside of the Tower. They were searched from head to toe to make sure that neither clothes nor food or dishes were hidden.\n\nAnd finally, her 16th birthday came, Khan was very glad that the old man's predictions were not true. He wanted to congratulate her on such a \"significant day\" and he entered her room with a bunch of grapes. Congratulating her and kissing, he handed her fruit, she took them and suddenly fell and died. Han looked around his gift ... and found a black Spider there.\n\nHan, in grief, so loudly sobbed that the Tower was shaking, and her top fell, leaving the ruins we see now.",

Medieval structure dates back with scientists to 1334 (14 century). Also close to it you will find an ancient cemetery, which is relative to 3-4 centuries.\n\nThe history of this structure is mysterious and covered with secrets. According to one of legends, one of the most beautiful mausoleums buried himself a Baatyr (powerful) Manas. They say that the mausoleum erected the son of Manas Semetey.\n\nAnd on other folk legend, it was built at the insistence of the faithful wife of baatyr - Kanykey. For making bricks of Kumbez, brought from far away a special clay, which was mixed with cow and goat wool. And in order to make the brick very durable, it was brewed in Kazan with fat of several thousand sheep. Kanykey buried with Manas jewels and treasures. And in order to save him from the raids of the robbers, she ordered to write a name of Kanizyak-Hatun.\n\nThere is another version of Kumbez's appearance. The third legend says that the body of a former hero, Kanykey has actually buried in distant caves at the foot of the mountains. To hide his body from the mockery of enemies and wretched.\n\nIn turn, archaeologists have proved that mausoleum was built over the grave of Emir's daughter Abuki Khatun's daughter. Researchers also claim that in order to build a Tomb, specially invited Masters from Bukhara, Samarkand and Kashgar.\n\nThey found out that Kumbez of Manas had been a place to bury other people. Dead buried in ancient coffins under the floor of the mausoleum. After a while they were destroyed, and in the same place created new burial sites.\n\nIn 1970, Soviet scientists conducted restoration of Kumbez. And the last restoration works ended in 1994 before the anniversary of the 1000-anniversary of the Manas epic.\n\nThe ancient structure is a quadrangular one chamber. Outside its sizes is 6m 80cm by 7m 10cm. the width of walls in some places can reach more than one meter, height approximately 11 m. and completes the construction of a Dome-shaped octagonal roof. Mausoleum is built of well-burned brick. The main facade is decorated both geometric and plant ornaments. The pattern of ornament is surprisingly similar to Kyrgyz national patterns.\n\nAlso on ornaments can be seen calligraphic inscriptions. When the Sun is lit, they create an interesting and complex light-Ray game. Art design of Kumbez is a bright example of how patterns of applied art are touching with architecture. The ancient monument has greatly influenced the development of the architecture of Kyrgyzstan.\n\nAfter reconstruction of Kumbez in 1970, the history of the Kyrgyz national complex \"Manas Ordo\" begins in this territory. The Museum complex includes Kumbez, Museum Reserve and mosque. Its area is covered by 225 hectares. the Memorial complex is interesting that all its components are built in national style.\n\nManas Ordo several times reorganized. Initially, it was a literary-ethnographic Museum, then the Museum-Reserve, regional complex, and finally, in 2001, he was named \"National complex Manas Ordo\".\n\nIn Manas Ordo, archaeological monuments, rock drawings, stone sculptures, Kurgan and petroglyphs and other monuments of Runic writing are located in Manas Ordo. They tell the rich history of the people that took place in these places and carries the imprint of the time of Baatyr Manas.",

Located in Chong-Tash, Ata Beyit, meaning \"Grave of our Fathers\" in the Kyrgyz language, is currently the site of many notable burials.\nLocated 30 kilometres from the capital, it was built in 2000 on the initiative of the first President of Kyrgyzstan, Askar Akayev in memory of the victims of the repressions in the village by Soviet authorities. When Kyrgyzstan was then known as the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic in 1938, Chong-Tash was the site of executions carried out against Central Asian nationalist movements by the NKVD (secret police) during the Great Purge ordered by Joseph Stalin, the Soviet leader. The killings remained largely covered up by the Committee for State Security of the Kyrgyz SSR until the site was rediscovered in 1991 and its caretaker (who had been sworn to secrecy by the KGB) revealed the location of the grave to his daughter following the dissolution of the USSR. On 30 August 1991, a state sponsored mourning ceremony for the remains some of the victims was held. The following day, the independence and sovereignty of Kyrgyzstan was proclaimed.\n\nThe bodies were then dug up and collectively interred at Ata Beyit 9 years later in the presence of President Akayev, other Kyrgyz/foreign dignitaries, and relatives of the dead. On the right side of the museum is a memorial plaque which has the engraved names all 137 victims. During the Days of History and Commemoration of Ancestors holiday on November 7–8, a procession to the memorial is held where the President of Kyrgyzstan lays a wreath to honour the victims. One of the more notable people buried at Ata Beyit, Kyrgyz and Soviet writer Chinghiz Aitmatov (buried in June 2008), was one of the founding organizers of the complex. He was buried alongside his father Törökul, who died circa 1938 in the Stalinist repressions. Victims of the Kyrgyz Revolution of 2010 were also buried here. In 2016, a monument to the 1916 Urkun was installed in the cemetery in a shape of a horizontal sculpture of a Tunduk (\"Тундук\") with a circular apex a traditional yurt.",

Thousands of years ago from the Dragon country (China) to this Valley came priests in clothes from Golden scales. They were the ministers of the sea God Ho.\n\nHaving founded in the Valley its city of Sai-Ho on the River River flowing in the Valley, they lived in peace for thousands of years and peace, worshipping their God with fish body and head of the man. God himself lived in a marble pond inside the temple. He taught local tribes agriculture, cattle breeding and other Sciences.\n\nAmong the ministers was the chief priest who died once a hundred years. Then the sacred ritual was conducted by the choice of a new priest. Among the inhabitants of the priests chose the most beautiful girl, which led to the reservoir. God-Ho was pouring out of the water and kissed the girl in the lips, through the positive period she gave birth to a child who became a new high priest.\n\nThousands of years lived in the Valley world, which was ruled by sea God, but suddenly there was trouble. Conquerors found secret passages to the Valley and burst into a forbidden city. Almost all the population and all priests were interrupted. The high priest prayed to his God and asked to punish the invaders. And the sea God came out of the water, announcing the Valley with a loud sound. The rocks surrounding the area collapsed, and the water drifted from the mountain tops down. All invaders were destroyed, and the water washed the last memories of the sea God and his people.

Here glaciers are adjacent with green coniferous forests and steppe areas. On three sides of the Valley is closed with ridges and lies at an altitude of 1400 to 2800 m above sea level. If below in the Valley heat Reigns, and green Meadows blooming, then at an altitude of 4700 m on kungey-Ala-too and Ilyish Ala-too lie eternal snow.\nChon-Kemin is a Paradise for fans of extreme tourism and lovers to travel around picturesque places.
