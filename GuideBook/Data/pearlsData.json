            "description": "Issyk-Kul – (\"hot lake\" in Kyrgyz) is the second largest (after the Caspian Sea) salt lake in the world, located at an altitude of 1609 m. The lake is 180 km long and 70 km wide, the depth in the deepest place reaches 668 meters (the average depth is 300 meters). The lake never freezes (hence its name), despite the fact that it is surrounded by snow-capped mountain peaks.\nThe Issyk-Kul region was unknown to the Western world until Russian researchers, such as, for example, Semenov-Tyan-Shansky, visited it with an expedition.\nIn the East, these places have been known since ancient times. The Chinese traveler Zhang Jian wrote about the lake, who visited Issyk-Kul in 128 BC. during his journey in 138-126 BC. The mention of the lake in the written sources of another Chinese explorer - Xuan Zhan is found in the description of his 16-year expedition.\nThe name «Issyk-Kul» is first found in the anonymous work \"The Borders of the World from East to West\", written in the Tajik language in 982 AD. This work also mentions the exact size of the lake.\nFrom Bishkek, you can get to Lake Issyk-Kul through the Boom Gorge, or take a shortcut through the Chon-Kemin Valley. The lake lies at the bottom of a depression and has no outflow. Mountains ring the lake, there are several valleys in its vicinity that are worth visiting: these are Grigoryevka and Semenovka in the north, Barskoon in the south and the valley around Karakol.\n\nThe Kungei (\"Sunny\") Ala-Too mountains are dotted with trekking routes in north side of the lake, including those that lead from the lake towards the city of Almaty, while in the south lie Teskey Ala-Too (\"Dark Mountains\"). These mountain ranges protect the Issyk-Kul depression from icy winds and dry winds. Moreover, the valley is a rare combination of a unique climate: sea, steppe, mountain and a zone of eternal glaciers. And the very emergence of Issyk-Kul is still a kind of \"geological mystery\".\n\nLake Issyk-Kul is a unique place in its own way, which is famous for its warm sandy beaches, thermo-mineral radon springs, alpine meadows, coniferous forests of the park type. All this splendor is located next to the fascinating mountain peaks and glaciers, among which there are many of the highest mountain verticals.\nKyrgyz refer to Lake Issyk-Kul as the \"Pearl of the Tyan Shan\". And in 2004, the government even declared the lake a national treasure.\n\nDue to its size, Issyk-Kul sometimes looks like a continental sea with a fairly large number of beaches. Most of the beach areas are located on the northern coast and are popular place to visit for tourists. A large number of hotels, sanatoriums, boarding houses and guest houses are located around the lake. The tourist season usually lasts from June to September, but the peak season falls on the period from July 25 to August 25. At this time, it is difficult to find a place in a hotel, and prices reach their limit.\nFor people with health problems, a wide range of effective spa treatment is offered. There is an excellent resort area with mud and spa treatment. In southern coast there is a Dead Salt Lake - an analogue of the Israeli Dead Sea.\nIssyk-Kul district is a nesting and resting place for many migratory and wintering birds, such as swans, geese, ducks, cranes, and many other representatives of the fauna.\nThe number of sunny hours per year in this region is 2,900. Due to the influence of mountain ranges in the north and south on the climate, this region does not suffer from sudden temperature changes. In summer, the temperature is usually about 25-28 °C, but since the lake is located at an altitude of about 1606 meters, it can be quite cool at night.",

The lake is already thought to be reported in the account given by Rubruquis of his voyage to the Qaraqorum, but he thinks it to be an inner sea, the oriental end of the Lake Balkach. He gives an approximate description of the area and mentions the winds, which are \"so strong that people do not traverse the lake without great peril.\"  A Russian traveller named Putimtsoff was the first to knowingly visit the lake in 1811. He gave a good description of it, mentioning rocks of different colours in the lake, and the furious winds blowing around the lake. Thirty years later Alexander Schrenk explored the lake and its surroundings.  Literally, the name Ala-kul would mean 'variegated lake,' although it probably takes its name from the Ala-Тoo mountains lying further north",

A huge percentage of water salinity places the lake on a par with the Dead Sea in Israel or the Great Salt Lake in the US, but on a smaller scale. For example, you can relax in the water without exerting any effort at all. Beware of water getting into your eyes, because there will be discomfort. The shore of the lake is covered with curative clay of different colors, as well as with sharp crystals of salt, which are formed from the drying out of water. The size of the lake is very small: the length of the coastline is 1.5 km, and the depth is 11m. Despite its very small size, because of its salinity, it does not freeze even in winter. Paradoxically, but very popular now, this lake was almost unknown until the 2000s, and more or less only started being visited by tourists in 2010. The lake is very close to the coastline of Issyk-Kul – just 400 meters away.

Scientists believe that in this place was previously a medieval capital city of Balasagun, owned by a large and powerful Turkic feudal Karakhanid Empire (X—XII centuries). While being on the Silk Road, the city was developed and considered one of the richest Central Asia settlements. In the XIII century Balasagun captured Mongols, and in two centuries it completely disappeared from the face of the Earth. From the former greatness remained only Burana Tower, ruins of fortress and defensive structures. During excavations, the remains of water pipes, luxury items and other evidences of the former greatness of the city were found.\n\nIn the 1970th there was reconstruction of the tower, when restored destroyed parts of the upper brickwork and was rebuilt the octagonal basement of the tower. Thanks to this, there are many tourists and local history enthusiasts come there to see the tower and climb to its top part through its preserved spiral staircase.\n\nToday among people there are many legends about origin, history and fate of the tower. According to one of the legends, one powerful Khan had a beautiful daughter named Monarch, whom he loved and protected. One day he called all the starkets and clairvoyants from the whole area and ordered the future of the girl. They all, except one, predicted a happy life to the girl. The same aksakal said, \"I can tell you only the truth, although you can and execute me for it. Your daughter's fate is sad. As soon as she lived to her 16th birthday, as a black Spider bites her, and she will die immediately.\"\n\nHan was furious, but he couldn't help but pay attention to that prediction. So he built a high Tower and had spent this Starship in a small room below the Tower, and his daughter placed in another room upstairs Tower in a single room.\n\nThe daughter grew in the Tower, admiring the valleys through four Windows in the Dome that came out on all sides of the world – North, South, East and West. The servants brought her food and water in the basket with food, climbed the stairs, mounted on the outside of the Tower. They were searched from head to toe to make sure that neither clothes nor food or dishes were hidden.\n\nAnd finally, her 16th birthday came, Khan was very glad that the old man's predictions were not true. He wanted to congratulate her on such a \"significant day\" and he entered her room with a bunch of grapes. Congratulating her and kissing, he handed her fruit, she took them and suddenly fell and died. Han looked around his gift ... and found a black Spider there.\n\nHan, in grief, so loudly sobbed that the Tower was shaking, and her top fell, leaving the ruins we see now.",

Medieval structure dates back with scientists to 1334 (14 century). Also close to it you will find an ancient cemetery, which is relative to 3-4 centuries.\n\nThe history of this structure is mysterious and covered with secrets. According to one of legends, one of the most beautiful mausoleums buried himself a Baatyr (powerful) Manas. They say that the mausoleum erected the son of Manas Semetey.\n\nAnd on other folk legend, it was built at the insistence of the faithful wife of baatyr - Kanykey. For making bricks of Kumbez, brought from far away a special clay, which was mixed with cow and goat wool. And in order to make the brick very durable, it was brewed in Kazan with fat of several thousand sheep. Kanykey buried with Manas jewels and treasures. And in order to save him from the raids of the robbers, she ordered to write a name of Kanizyak-Hatun.\n\nThere is another version of Kumbez's appearance. The third legend says that the body of a former hero, Kanykey has actually buried in distant caves at the foot of the mountains. To hide his body from the mockery of enemies and wretched.\n\nIn turn, archaeologists have proved that mausoleum was built over the grave of Emir's daughter Abuki Khatun's daughter. Researchers also claim that in order to build a Tomb, specially invited Masters from Bukhara, Samarkand and Kashgar.\n\nThey found out that Kumbez of Manas had been a place to bury other people. Dead buried in ancient coffins under the floor of the mausoleum. After a while they were destroyed, and in the same place created new burial sites.\n\nIn 1970, Soviet scientists conducted restoration of Kumbez. And the last restoration works ended in 1994 before the anniversary of the 1000-anniversary of the Manas epic.\n\nThe ancient structure is a quadrangular one chamber. Outside its sizes is 6m 80cm by 7m 10cm. the width of walls in some places can reach more than one meter, height approximately 11 m. and completes the construction of a Dome-shaped octagonal roof. Mausoleum is built of well-burned brick. The main facade is decorated both geometric and plant ornaments. The pattern of ornament is surprisingly similar to Kyrgyz national patterns.\n\nAlso on ornaments can be seen calligraphic inscriptions. When the Sun is lit, they create an interesting and complex light-Ray game. Art design of Kumbez is a bright example of how patterns of applied art are touching with architecture. The ancient monument has greatly influenced the development of the architecture of Kyrgyzstan.\n\nAfter reconstruction of Kumbez in 1970, the history of the Kyrgyz national complex \"Manas Ordo\" begins in this territory. The Museum complex includes Kumbez, Museum Reserve and mosque. Its area is covered by 225 hectares. the Memorial complex is interesting that all its components are built in national style.\n\nManas Ordo several times reorganized. Initially, it was a literary-ethnographic Museum, then the Museum-Reserve, regional complex, and finally, in 2001, he was named \"National complex Manas Ordo\".\n\nIn Manas Ordo, archaeological monuments, rock drawings, stone sculptures, Kurgan and petroglyphs and other monuments of Runic writing are located in Manas Ordo. They tell the rich history of the people that took place in these places and carries the imprint of the time of Baatyr Manas.",

The mountain lake Sary-Chelek is situated at about 2,000 meters above sea level, with an area of 470 hectares and a depth of 245 meters.\n\nThe high mountain lake Sary-Chelek is reasonably considered one of the most beautiful places in Kyrgyzstan. As a result of the collapse of two ridges that blocked the River, it was formed a miracle where all tourists of the country strive. Rocks surrounding the Lake are not fully aware of this. The place is so beautiful and mysterious that involuntarily legends themselves are folded, or otherwise it is difficult to explain the mystery of this Lake. It is impossible to see the bottom even at the shores, on it not sit birds, in it not inhabit fish, and there is no seaweed, and the coasts are deserted. Therefore, every rare inhabitant of the Lake whether it is an animal or plant carries its incredible legend. And one of the stories about the origin of the Lake itself says about the huge snake living in it.\n\nIn the old days on the site of the Lake Sary-Chelek was a huge Valley. Thousands of years ago from the Dragon country (China) to this Valley came priests in clothes from Golden scales. They were the ministers of the sea God Ho.\n\nHaving founded in the Valley its city of Sai-Ho on the River River flowing in the Valley, they lived in peace for thousands of years and peace, worshipping their God with fish body and head of the man. God himself lived in a marble pond inside the temple. He taught local tribes agriculture, cattle breeding and other Sciences.\n\nAmong the ministers was the chief priest who died once a hundred years. Then the sacred ritual was conducted by the choice of a new priest. Among the inhabitants of the priests chose the most beautiful girl, which led to the reservoir. God-Ho was pouring out of the water and kissed the girl in the lips, through the positive period she gave birth to a child who became a new high priest.\n\nThousands of years lived in the Valley world, which was ruled by sea God, but suddenly there was trouble. Conquerors found secret passages to the Valley and burst into a forbidden city. Almost all the population and all priests were interrupted. The high priest prayed to his God and asked to punish the invaders. And the sea God came out of the water, announcing the Valley with a loud sound. The rocks surrounding the area collapsed, and the water drifted from the mountain tops down. All invaders were destroyed, and the water washed the last memories of the sea God and his people. So Lake Sarah-Chelek, in which and now can live sea God-Ho.",
